enterprise_warp
===============

enterprise_warp is a set of tools for pulsar timing analysis with `Enterprise <https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise/>`__, `Libstempo <https://github.com/vallis/libstempo/>`__ and `Tempo2 <https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/tempo2>`. It uses the `Bilby <https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby/>`__ to enable Bayesian inference for pulsar timing arrays using many different samplers and all other advantages of Bilby.

Look how easy it is to run from the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python run_example_paramfile.py --prfile example_params/default_model_dynesty.dat --num 0

More examples are available. Browse the documentation website for more details.

Features
--------

- Configure your runs with parameter files instead of editing python scripts. This allows easier management of your data analysis progress. Keep track of your input and output directories.

- The code is optimized for parallel computing via the usage of command line arguments (i.e., for different pulsars)

- Simply choose any MCMC/Nested sampler that is available in Bilby: PTMCMCSampler, Dynesty, Nestle, PyPolyChord, PyMC3, ptmcee, and more. Evaluate evidence, perform parameter estimation, or directly compare models with product-space method and PTMCMCSampler.

- Accellerate your data analysis with MPI using PyPolychord sampler: distribute heavy calculations between ~10-100 cores of a supercomputer. The code has special options for MPI runs.

- Use noise model files with tailored noise models for each pulsar and common noise processes in all pulsars. Run analysis with individual pulsars or the whole pulsar timing array.

- Save time on setting up runs: all sampler keyword arguments, your custom noise models and priors are automatically recongized in parameter files.

- Easily add your own models, using several examples. Or load models from `enterprise_extensions <https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise_extensions/>`__ or other code.

- And more!
